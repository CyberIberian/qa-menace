# Module 1 — QA Fundamentals (1-pager)

## 1) What QA / Testing is
- **Goal of QA/testing:**  
- Testing is NOT debugging because:  
- Testing answers the question: “_____”

## 2) Bug / Defect basics
- **Error:**  
- **Defect/Bug:**  
- **Failure:**  

## 3) Why we test (pick your top 3)
- ( ) Prevent costly failures
- ( ) Build confidence in releases
- ( ) Find defects early
- ( ) Verify requirements
- ( ) Validate user needs
- ( ) Provide information for decisions

My top 3: ___, ___, ___

## 4) Bug lifecycle (typical workflow)
**New → Triaged → Assigned → In Progress → Fixed → Ready for Test → Retest → Verified → Closed**

Possible side outcomes:
- Reopened
- Duplicate
- Won’t Fix
- Not a Bug
- Cannot Reproduce

## 5) Verification vs Validation
- **Verification =** “Are we building it right?”
  Example:
- **Validation =** “Are we building the right thing?”
  Example:

## 6) Severity vs Priority
- **Severity =** how bad the impact is (technical/user harm)
- **Priority =** how urgently it should be fixed (business timing)

Examples:
- **High severity / low priority:**
- **Low severity / high priority:**

## 7) My QA mindset rule (1 sentence)
> “I don’t just find bugs — I ______________________________.”
